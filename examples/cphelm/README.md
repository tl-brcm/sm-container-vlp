# examples/cphelm - copy helm repository to a GITHUB page
that serves as a helm repository.
This example uses a base git branch (GITFROM)
to receive the Broadcom helm repository
and uses helm repo index to recalculate the index.yaml. 

The result is then pushed up to the GITHUB using the same branch.
